The goal of this project was to determine if we can accurately predict whether a car has high or low fuel efficiency (MPG) based on its technical specifications. This is a classic binary classification problem: is the car a "gas-guzzler" (0) or "fuel-efficient" (1)?

# Key findings
## Takeaway

### **Results**

My goal was to predict if a car's MPG was high or low (a binary classification problem).

EDA: I used boxplots to confirm that features like weight, horsepower, and cylinders are strongly correlated with MPG.

Modeling: I built a Logistic Regression model to predict the "high/low" MPG class.

Result: The model was highly effective, achieving [Your Accuracy Here]% accuracy on the test data!

This was a great exercise in the end-to-end data analysis workflow: from feature engineering (creating the mpg01 variable) and EDA (visualizing relationships) to building and evaluating a predictive model.
