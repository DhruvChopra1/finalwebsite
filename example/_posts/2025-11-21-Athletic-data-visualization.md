This post dives into data from a recent athlete combine, merging results from the Countermovement Jump, 40-Yard Dash, Pro Agility shuttle, and Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull.

We analyzed this combined dataset to uncover the hidden relationships between explosive power, linear speed, and pure static strength.

# Key findings
## Athletic performance data

### **Findings**

This document provides a analysis of the process used to determine the correlation from given combine data of atheletes in our school.

1.  **Explosive Power is King: 1:** The strongest relationships in the data were between explosive movements. Athletes with a higher vertical jump were significantly faster in both the 40-yard dash and the pro-agility test.
2.  **Speed Translates: 2:** We found a very strong link between linear speed (the 40-yard dash) and change-of-direction speed (pro-agility). If an athlete is fast in a straight line, they are very likely to be fast in a shuttle test.
3.  **The 'Strength' Surprise: 3:** The most interesting discovery was that an athlete's static strength (measured by the Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull) had no statistically significant correlation with any of the dynamic tests (jumping or sprinting).
4.  **Clear Performance Groups: 4:** As expected, the analysis clearly visualized distinct performance clusters, with male and female athletes grouping separately across the various tests.
