Git can seem intimidating when you're starting out, but mastering a few key concepts and commands will dramatically improve your development workflow. Here's a practical guide based on what I wish I had known when I started.

## Why Git Matters

Git is more than just a backup systemâ€”it's a time machine for your code. It allows you to:
- Track every change in your project
- Collaborate with others without conflicts
- Experiment with confidence
- Revert to working versions when things break

## Essential Git Commands

### Starting a Repository
```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
