  My journey of creating this website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, including the challenges I faced and solutions I discovered.

---

When I decided to create my personal website, I wanted something that was both professional and easy to maintain. After researching various options, I settled on Jekyll with the Hydejack theme, hosted on GitHub Pages.

## The Challenge

As someone relatively new to static site generators, I faced several hurdles:
- Understanding Jekyll's file structure
- Configuring the theme properly
- Managing assets and permalinks
- Deploying to GitHub Pages

## The Learning Process

### 1. File Structure Matters
One of my biggest initial mistakes was not maintaining the proper folder structure when copying theme files. Jekyll relies heavily on convention, and files need to be in specific directories:

```
├── _layouts/     # Page templates
├── _includes/    # Reusable components  
├── _sass/        # Styling
├── _posts/       # Blog posts
└── assets/       # Images, CSS, JS
```

### 2. Configuration is Key
The `_config.yml` file is the heart of any Jekyll site. Key lessons:
- Use `remote_theme` for GitHub Pages deployment
- Set proper `baseurl` for subdirectory hosting
- Configure permalinks thoughtfully for SEO

### 3. GitHub Pages Deployment
Understanding the difference between local development and GitHub Pages deployment was crucial. Some gems work locally but not on GitHub Pages due to security restrictions.

## What I Built

This website now features:
- Responsive design with Hydejack theme
- Blog functionality for sharing thoughts
- Project showcase section
- About page with my background

## Next Steps

Moving forward, I plan to:
- Add more interactive elements
- Integrate analytics to understand visitor behavior
- Expand the project portfolio
- Write more technical tutorials

## Resources That Helped

- [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- [Hydejack Theme Guide](https://hydejack.com/)
- [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

Building this website taught me that the best way to learn is by doing. Every error message and debugging session was a step forward in understanding how modern web development works.

  Reflections on the most important lessons I've discovered during my programming journey, from debugging to collaboration.

As I reflect on my coding journey so far, there are several key lessons that have shaped not just how I write code, but how I approach problems in general.

## 1. Embrace the Debugging Process

**The Lesson**: Debugging isn't a sign of failure—it's an integral part of development.

When I first started coding, encountering errors felt like personal defeats. Now I understand that debugging is where real learning happens. Each error message is a teacher, guiding you toward better understanding.

**What Changed**: I started keeping a debugging journal, noting common errors and their solutions. This practice has made me a more efficient problem-solver.

## 2. Read Code More Than You Write It

**The Lesson**: Understanding existing code is often more valuable than writing new code.

Early in my journey, I was eager to build everything from scratch. I've learned that studying well-written codebases teaches you patterns, conventions, and best practices that no tutorial can match.

**What This Means**: Before starting a new project, I spend time researching existing solutions and understanding how experienced developers approach similar problems.

## 3. Documentation is Love for Future You

**The Lesson**: Good documentation isn't optional—it's essential.

The code you write today will be foreign to you in six months. Comments, README files, and proper documentation aren't just for others; they're gifts to your future self.

**My Practice**: I now write documentation as I code, not as an afterthought. If I can't explain what my code does simply, it probably needs refactoring.

## 4. Community Over Competition

**The Lesson**: Programming is collaborative, not competitive.

The most successful developers I know are those who freely share knowledge, ask questions, and help others. The programming community thrives on mutual support.

**How I Apply This**: I actively participate in coding communities, contribute to discussions, and never hesitate to ask for help when stuck.

## 5. Perfect is the Enemy of Done

**The Lesson**: Ship it, then improve it.

I used to spend weeks perfecting code before sharing it. I've learned that getting feedback early and iterating quickly leads to better results than trying to achieve perfection in isolation.

**The Balance**: This doesn't mean shipping broken code, but rather finding the sweet spot between quality and progress.

## Looking Forward

These lessons continue to guide my development as both a programmer and a problem-solver. The journey of learning to code has taught me as much about myself as it has about technology.

What lessons have shaped your coding journey? I'd love to hear your experiences and insights.

  A beginner-friendly guide to essential Git commands and workflows that every developer should know.

Git can seem intimidating when you're starting out, but mastering a few key concepts and commands will dramatically improve your development workflow. Here's a practical guide based on what I wish I had known when I started.

## Why Git Matters

Git is more than just a backup system—it's a time machine for your code. It allows you to:
- Track every change in your project
- Collaborate with others without conflicts
- Experiment with confidence
- Revert to working versions when things break

## Essential Git Commands

### Starting a Repository

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# Check the status of your files
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add filename.txt
git add .  # adds all files

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add feature description"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main
```

### Checking History

```bash
# View commit history
git log

# View a simplified history
git log --oneline

# See what changed in a specific commit
git show commit-hash
```

## A Simple Daily Workflow

Here's the workflow I use every day:

1. **Start your day**: `git pull` to get latest changes
2. **Make changes**: Edit your files
3. **Check status**: `git status` to see what's changed
4. **Stage changes**: `git add .` to stage all changes
5. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Descriptive message"`
6. **Push**: `git push origin main`

## Best Practices I've Learned

### Write Good Commit Messages
```bash
# Bad
git commit -m "fixed stuff"

# Good  
git commit -m "Fix navigation menu alignment on mobile devices"
```

### Commit Early and Often
Small, frequent commits are better than large, infrequent ones. They're easier to understand and debug.

### Use Branches for Features
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b new-feature

# Work on your feature, then merge back
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

### "I Made a Mistake in My Last Commit"
```bash
# If you haven't pushed yet
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo commit, keep changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Undo commit, discard changes
```

### "I Want to See What Changed"
```bash
# See changes before staging
git diff

# See staged changes
git diff --staged
```

### "I Want to Ignore Certain Files"
Create a `.gitignore` file:
```
node_modules/
.env
*.log
.DS_Store
```

## Learning by Doing

The best way to learn Git is by using it daily. Start with these basics, and gradually explore more advanced features like branching, merging, and rebasing.

## Resources for Deeper Learning

- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- [GitHub's Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [Interactive Git Tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

Remember: everyone makes Git mistakes. The key is learning from them and getting comfortable with the basic commands. Once these become second nature, you'll wonder how you ever developed without version control.
